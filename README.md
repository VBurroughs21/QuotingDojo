# QuotingDojo
Coding Dojo Assignment


Assignment: QuotingDojo
Build a simple app that allows users to add quotes to a database and display them on a separate page.  You should have 4 php pages for this project: 

index.php: where users will add their quotes<br>
main.php: where all the quotes are displayed<br>
process.php: process your form data here<br>
connection.php: for connecting your pages to the database!<br>
The 'add my quote' button should add the user's quote to the database, but the 'skip to quotes' button should take the user directly to the main page.  

Please include simple validation that checks for the presence of the user's name and their quote.

HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL.
